The whole purpose\r\nof this particular tree is to build a core library, a driver binary\r\n(more on that) and a few plugins to get the show started. Check out\r\n[this weblog post][post] to really understand the mission behind Wintermute.\r\n_Yes, this is yet another Internet of Things project._ But this isn't meant to\r\nbe \"web scale\" or all of that. It's meant to work in a controlled environment\r\nunder specific constraints (most devices running Linux, etc).\r\n\r\n# Building & Contributing\r\nBuilding, requirement and installation information all live in\r\n[`INSTALL.markdown`][install]. Pointers for contributing on the project are\r\nlocated in [`CONTRIBUTING.markdown`][contrib]. So far, Wintermute works on a\r\n[few platforms][platforms], but feel free to build for yours and try it out.\r\nThis project is [Vagrant][] enabled.\r\n\r\n**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.** But in due time, my\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n# TODO\r\n\r\n  + [ ] abstracted configuration framework\r\n  + [ ] preliminary RPC framework (using modules + calls)\r\n  + [x] plugin loading infrastructure\r\n  + [x] versioning support\r\n\r\n[post]: http://jalcine.me/weblog/ambitions-wintermute/\r\n[build_stat]: https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/wintermute?branch=develop\r\n[cover_stat]: https://coveralls.io/r/jalcine/wintermute?branch=develop\r\n[waffleio]: http://waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute\r\n[travisdevelop_img]: https://travis-ci.org/jalcine/wintermute.svg?branch=develop\r\n[coverallsdevelop_img]: https://img.shields.io/coveralls/jalcine/wintermute.svg?branch=develop\r\n[waffle_ready_img]: https://badge.waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute.png?label=ready&title=Ready\r\n[waffle_work_img]: https://badge.waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute.png?label=In%20Progress&title=In%20Progress\r\n[issuegraph]: https://graphs.waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute/throughput.svg\r\n[issuelink]: https://waffle.io/jalcine/wintermute/metrics\r\n[contrib]: ./CONTRIBUTING.markdown\r\n[install]: ./INSTALL.markdown\r\n[platforms]: ./INSTALL.markdown#platforms\r\n[vagrant]: https://vagrantup.com\r\n[neuromancer]: http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22328\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
