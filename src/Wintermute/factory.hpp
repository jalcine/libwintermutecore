/**
 * @brief Handles the loading and manufacturing of plug-ins.
 *
 * Factory is responsible for handling each plug-in that interacts with this
 * process. It handles the [loading][] and [unloading][] of plug-ins as well
 * as determining which plug-ins are designated for [auto-loading][].
 *
 * ## Loading A %Plugin
 *
 * The start of a plugin's load begins with its name. We'll use
 * `wintermute-heartbeat` for this case, but it can be any name that can also
 * be used for a library name. Factory does the following:
 *
 *  - **Locates Metadata** Obtain the plugin's meta information, as much as
 *  possible. At the moment, the only two bits of data we'd need is the
 *  version of the plug-in and the system version. This is how we determine
 *  whether or not loading this plug-in would cause a loading issue.
 *
 *  - **Check ABI**: Determine whether or not this plug-in will work properly in
 *    this version of Wintermute. Simple decimal number comparison.
 *
 *  - **Load binary**: Loads the binary.
 *
 * [loading]: @ref Factory::loadPlugin
 * [unloading]: @ref Factory::unloadPlugin
 * [auto-loading]: @ref Factory::autoloadPlugins
