# Synopsis 
Wintermute's a software project that intends to be a launching pad into
self-driven hyper-connectivity of hardware and software. The whole purpose
of this particular tree is to build a core library, a driver binary
(more on that) and a few plugins to get the show started. I wrote 
little [blog post][post1] about it, expect another soon.

# Building & Contributing
Building, requirement and installation information all live in
[`INSTALL.markdown`][install]. Pointers for contributing on the project are
located in [`CONTRIBUTING.markdown`][contrib]. So far, Wintermute works on a
[few platforms][platforms]

**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.** But in due time, my
