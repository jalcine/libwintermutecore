# Synopsis 
Wintermute's a software project of [Jacky Alcin√©][jacky] that intends to be a
launching pad into self-driven hyper-connectivity of hardware and software. The
whole purpose of this particular tree is to build a core library, a driver
binary (more on that) and a few plugins to get the show started. I wrote a
little [blog post][post1] about it, expect another soon.

Building, requirement and installation information all live in
[`INSTALL.markdown`][install].

**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.**
