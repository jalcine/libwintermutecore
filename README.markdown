# Synopsis
Wintermute's a software project inspired by a few books, movies and projects
that I (Jacky Alcin√©) aim to have as an actor for multiple devices and
platforms. I've written about [my ambitions for Wintermute][post] to give an
grandiose vision to the project.

# Building & Contributing
Building, requirement and installation information all live in
[`INSTALL.markdown`][install]. Pointers for contributing on the project are
located in [`CONTRIBUTING.markdown`][contrib]. So far, Wintermute works on a
[few platforms][platforms], but feel free to build for yours and try it out.
This project is [Vagrant][] enabled.

**This is alpha software, so alpha that it does nothing.** But in due time, my
friend.

# Platform Support

Currently, this is being built and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 64-bit. I haven't a
plan to target other platforms as of yet but this is intended to have support
for:

  * Raspberry Pi Debian
  * Android 5.0
  * vanilla Debian 8

# TODO

  + [ ] abstracted configuration framework
  + [ ] preliminary RPC framework (using modules + calls)
  + [x] plugin loading infrastructure
  + [x] versioning support
